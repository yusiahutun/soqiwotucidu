She is a model, singer, actress, and celebrity in her own right. She didn’t become famous no Paris was born famous! In case you still don’t understand Paris Jackson is the only daughter of the late music legend attributed to the king of pop Michael Jackson.</b></p><p><strong>Paris Jackson Age, Parents, Father</strong></p><p>Paris Jackson was born on April 3, 1998, in Beverly Hills, California the second child of her parents Michael Jackson and Debbie Rowe. Her mother Debbie is a nurse and was married to pop icon Michael Jackson for three years (between 1996 and 1999) before their divorce.</p><p>Although she is the only daughter of her parents Paris is not the only child. The model and singer are sandwiched between two boys. Her older brother who was born a year later is Michael Joseph Jackson Jr. and her younger brother is a half-brother because he was not the biological child of her mother Prince Michael Blanket Jackson II. Confused names huh? You could, however, differentiate between the two by calling the first one “Joseph” and the second one “Blanket”.</p><p>Paris and her older brother Joseph were raised by their father after Debbie Rowe confiscated custody of the children from him. And since his childhood was “stolen” (as he always says) he made it his top priority to let his children have as normal a childhood as possible. His efforts to protect them from the press media and the public were so terrible that he wore them every time they went out in public.</p><p>As expected, she attended Buckley School which is a very exclusive school in Sherman Oaks, California with her brother, and there she participated in extracurricular activities such as cheerleading while playing softball.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a class=mentionable href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-mentionable=947>Kaley Cuoco Net Worth, Weight, Height, Measurements, Feet</a></strong></p><p>One year after her father’s death Paris (and her brothers) accepted a Grammy Award – Lifetime Achievement Award – on behalf of their father at the 2010 Grammy Awards. They also participated in Oprah Winfrey’s show with their grandmother Katherine Jackson and talked about what it meant to be raised as a Michael Jackson child and what it meant to have lost him.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Paris Jackson experienced a difficult period of her life following the death of her father which led to self-harming and addiction to intravenous drugs. In an effort to help Paris get back on track she was enrolled in Utah’s Diamond Ranch Academy – a therapeutic boarding school – for her sophomore and junior years. In March 2019, reports surfaced that Paris had attempted suicide again; however these were denied by both herself and sources close to her who confirmed that there had simply been an accident at home.</p><p>Paris Jackson has been linked to a number of high-profile relationships over the years, including soccer player Chester Castellaw in 2015 and musician Michael Snoddy from 2016 to 2017. In 2019 Jackson reportedly began dating her bandmate Gabriel Glenn; the two have since appeared together on Facebook Watch’s “Unfiltered: Paris Jackson & Gabriel Glenn” where she revealed that she had “dated more women than men.” In 2018 a 23-year-old man named Nicholas Stevens was granted a temporary restraining order against her for stalking.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Paris Jackson Career</strong></h2><p>Paris Jackson started in showbiz just like her father. Her musical career has led her to create a group called The Sunflowers, which first performed in June 2018 at Canyon Sessions. She wanted her father to stay around much longer to teach her about the moonwalk tricks he promised to do before he met his death.</p><p>She was part of the distribution of the 2011 screen adaptation of the book Lundon’s Bridge and the Three Keys, written by Dennis Christen. It was supposed to be a fantastic film for children but the film did not see the light of day. And that will not be the only time that a venture she got involved in will not see the light of day.</p><p>In 2013 the Jackson children and their grandmother decided to produce a documentary about the life of hip-hop star Michael Jackson. The documentary was to be called Remembering Michael and they decided to raise the funds necessary to continue the project with public funding (an account was created on the FundAnything website). However, the idea turned against her when it became clear that one Sonia Lowe was involved in the project. This made Michael’s fans very angry and there was no more fundraising which by extension means that the documentary was put on hold indefinitely.</p><p>People Magazine named Paris to its list of the Most Beautiful in 2012 and the model also made the cover of an edition of Rolling Stone magazine in 2017. The last move opened her to modeling opportunities and in March of the same year, she was hired at IMG Models.</p><p>Paris also made her television debut (guest role) in the dramatic series FOX entitled Star in the same month (March). She made her big-screen debut the following year in 2018, as Nelly in the detective drama Gringo.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Paris Jackson Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Paris is expected to have a net worth that would blow the mind of being the only daughter of the late Michael Jackson and of course, there is no disappointment. Paris Jackson has a net worth of $100 million, as she inherited a huge estate from her father and still receives an annual allowance of about $8 million from the estate. But in addition, she seems to have found her own foot in showbiz with acting advertising campaigns, and modeling.</p><p>Since the passing of her father Michael Jackson in 2009, Paris has become a more visible public figure. She has shared her stories on various talk shows about the unique upbringing she experienced and bullying she endured while at school. In 2012, Paris was honored with a spot on People Magazine’s Most Beautiful People list and further cemented her place as an icon when Rolling Stone featured her on their cover in 2017. Additionally, since 2017 she has served as an ambassador for The Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation to help fight against this global epidemic.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong><span id=Paris_Jacksons_Cars>Paris Jackson’s Cars</span></strong></h2><p>Paris Jackson recently made a major purchase of a Porsche 911 for $280,000 USD.

Mom</strong></p><p>There have been controversies about the three children born to the late pop star Micheal Jackson, and there are real reasons why this is so. The very obvious reason is that Michael’s three children are white and when you add the fact that all three were born by artificial insemination the plot begins to thicken. However, we have come to believe that Joseph, Paris and Blanket were all begotten by Michael Jackson and therefore until proven otherwise with substantial evidence there may be no reason to maintain these doubts.</p><p>The music icon was first married to Lisa Marie Presley, the only daughter of the showbiz parents Elvis and Priscilla Presley on May 26, 1994. She had just divorced her first husband Danny Keough, 20 days earlier. However, two years after the beginning of the union that did not produce children they divorced in 1996 which was when Michael met Debbie Rowe.</p><p>She was a dermatology nurse and worked at the clinic where the pop star went to treat vitiligo. He told her about his need to have children and Debbie who already had a crush on the superstar voluntarily submitted to help her have children. This led to their marriage in 1996 after she was confirmed pregnant. It was her second marriage after Richard Edelman’s in 1982.</p><p>In February 1997, she gave birth to a baby boy Michael Joseph Jackson Jr., then Paris followed in 1998. Being a very private person Debbie could not face scrutiny and media attention her marriage with the icon brought her and they divorced on October 8, 1999, Debbie had granted full custody of her children to their father.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a class=mentionable href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-mentionable=548>Heidi Klum Bio, Children, Husband, Net Worth and Family Life</a></strong></p><p>She has publicly stated that she was pregnant with artificial insemination and everyone is now wondering who the sperm donor was. Paris’ younger brother <a href=#>Blanket Jackson</a> was also born to a surrogate mother whose identity is not known till date.</p><p>Unfortunately, Mark Lester (who was her godfather) claimed after Michael Jackson’s death that he was Paris Jackson’s father because he said he was the sperm donor for the pregnancy that caused her. He also said he was ready to do a DNA test to authenticate his claims. However, although the test does not appear to be part of the short-term plan observers questioned the sincerity of his statements by questioning the timing of his assertions.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Body Facts – Tattoos, Weight, Height</strong></h2><p>Paris Jackson is not short of height.

However, since then it has been able to generate an impressive $700 million from royalties and other sources such as licensing deals and box office proceeds for the film “This is It”.
