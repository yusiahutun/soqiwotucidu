Decades ago, a vicious cabal of male poets contrived—quite publicly and successfully—to undermine the writing career, confidence, and health of their dear friend Fern. Now, after Fern has taken a turn for the worse, her three old friends decide that it’s finally time to strike back—in secret, of course, since Fern is far too gentle to approve of a vendetta. All they need is a plan with suitably Shakespearean drama. But as sweet and satisfying as revenge can be, it’s not always so cut and dried.”</p><p><strong>Amazon First Reads Editor Review: </strong>“Knives out, everyone—cheese knives, that is. Pull up a patio chair and imagine Only Murders in the Building if the Golden Girls moved in.</p><p>Out in the back garden, three old friends are meeting up for drinks—and revenge. Chrissy (in lavender), Myrna (in earth tones), and Leonie (in hibiscus print) are plotting on behalf of their friend Fern, a fellow retired professor. Many years ago now, Fern inadvertently stepped on the toes of a critics’-darling male novelist, and he and his writer friends made it their mission to bring her down. Her career—and her health—suffered for it, and now she’s taken a turn for the worse. It’s time for some poetic justice.</p><p>Margaret Atwood, with her delightfully wicked sense of humor, reminds us that friendship is about showing up for each other—even when nothing goes as planned.”</p><p><strong>—Kjersti Egerdahl, Amazon First Reads Editor</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/the-alone-time-elle-marr-amazon.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=the-alone-time-by-elle-marr>The Alone Time by Elle Marr</h2><ul><li><strong>Genre: </strong>Psychological Thriller</li><li><strong>Rating: </strong>3.8 out of 5 (519 reviews)</li></ul><p><strong>Amazon Synopsis:</strong> “Fiona and Violet Seng were just children when their family’s Cessna crash-landed in the Washington wilderness, claiming the lives of their parents. For twelve harrowing weeks, the girls fended for themselves before being rescued.</p><p>Twenty-five years later, they’re still trying to move on from the trauma. Fiona repurposes it into controversial works of art. Violet has battled addiction and failed relationships to finally progress toward normalcy as a writer. The estranged sisters never speak about what they call their Alone Time in the wild. They wouldn’t dare—until they become the subject of a documentary that renews public fascination with the “girl survivors” and questions their version of the events.</p><p>When disturbing details about the Seng family are exposed, a strange woman claims to know the crash was deliberate. Fiona and Violet must come together to face the horrifying truth of what happened out there and what they learned about their parents and themselves.

Crash-landing in the Washington wilderness, the sisters spent months trying to survive. Twenty-five years later, they have no interest in reliving their alone time and are unwilling to speak about the harrowing experience. Fiona uses her art as a soothing balm for her pain, and Violet has battled with her own vices. But now a documentary film crew has renewed public interest in the girls who survived…and whether or not their version of events is true.</p><p>The Alone Time is a thriller that not only delivers twist after twist but also explores the bonds of family. As the sisters are forced to relive the secrets and psychological wounds of their pasts, I couldn’t look away.

One is the haunted history of Davidson Tower, where more than fifty years ago, two ill-fated lovers disappeared in a devastating fire. The other is Ravi Kumar, a privileged billionaire nepo baby who’s aggravatingly charming and occupying more brain space than Jessie has room for. Things change when a campus prank locks them both in the old tower’s ghostly library.”</p><p>There, Jessie finds letters from the fabled lost lovers, forgotten in a hollowed-out copy of Persuasion. One by one, the letters suck Jessie and Ravi into a beguiling mystery and an achingly beautiful long-ago romance destined to go up in flames. It’s also drawing Jessie and Ravi—every bit as star-crossed—closer together. Can they overcome whatever fate has in store for them? Or are they just as doomed as the young lovers whose tragic end has become legend?</p><p><strong>Amazon First Reads Editor Review:</strong> “For bookish people out there, what’s more romantic than falling in love in the stacks of an old college library?</p><p>Nisha Sharma, author of Dating Dr. Dil and The Karma Map, has written a romance about a decades-old mystery that brings two people from different worlds together.

A world traveler since birth, Paige loves to lead activities for guests at a luxury island resort in Turks and Caicos. From bingo nights to cliffside hikes, Paige is up for anything. Cole, meanwhile, prefers his number-crunching desk job. He’s the assistant director at the resort—stiff and meticulous. He’s so by the book that he keeps the book. In his desk drawer.</p><p>They’re perfectly aligned in one way, though—their ability to drive each other crazy. Every day brings a fresh battle of wits. They’re rivals, archnemeses…and they’re definitely never going to talk about that one time they kissed. Ha ha. Nope!</p><p>But when Paige finds out that Cole has been ordered to fire her on the same day a hurricane threatens their little slice of paradise, it’s clear the game is over.</p><p>At odds, in peril, and forced to shelter in place together, these two enemies might finally have to confront their true feelings. (You know, the ones hidden under all those withering looks.)”</p><p><strong>Amazon First Reads Editor Review: </strong>“Opposites attract,” “enemies to lovers,” “forced proximity,” and “workplace romance” are only some of the delightful tropes you’ll find in this romp of a romantic comedy! Author R.S. Grey has crafted a truly hilarious story set in an idyllic location—a luxury vacation resort in Turks and Caicos. Think The Hating Game set in a tropical paradise. Yes, please. Sign me up.</p><p>The main characters’ opposing personalities—Paige Young is all sunshine, while Cole Clark is a grumpy Clark Kent—make the perfect fodder for hilarious misunderstandings and unrelenting banter. Of course, I know that humor is subjective, but if you: (a) like romance, (b) like to laugh, and (c) don’t mind a little spice with your love story, then I truly believe this book is the one for you.</p><p>However, if you’re anything like Cole Clark’s beige-loving, more-robot-than human, order-salad-at-a-steakhouse parents, then I think you might actually want to skip this one. Maybe try something with “finance” in the title. For the rest of us, Their Last Resort might just be our next vacation destination.”</p><p><strong>—Maria Gomez, Amazon First Reads Editor</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/the-bootleggers-daughter-nadine-nettmann-amazon.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=the-bootlegger-s-daughter-by-nadine-nettmann>The Bootlegger’s Daughter by Nadine Nettmann</h2><ul><li><strong>Genre:</strong> Historial Fiction</li><li><strong>Rating: </strong>4.4 out of 5 (537 reviews)</li></ul><p><strong>Amazon Synopsis:</strong> “It’s 1927. Letty Hart’s father is long gone, but his old winery provides a meager wage and a legal livelihood for selling sacramental wine. But when that contract goes bust, Letty stumbles upon a desperate option: her father’s hidden cellar—and enough liquor to tempt Letty to bootleg the secret stash. In an underworld dominated by merciless men, Letty is building an empire.</p><p>Officer Annabel Forman deserves to be the first female detective in the LAPD. But after two years on the force, she’s still consigned to clerical work and policing dance halls. When Annabel connects a series of unsolved murders to bootlegging, it’s a chance at a real investigation. Under the thumb of dismissive male superiors, Annabel is building her case.</p><p>As their formerly uncompromised morals erode, Letty and Annabel are on a collision course—and determined to prove they’re every bit as ruthless and strong-willed as the powers that be who want to take them down.”</p><p><strong>Amazon First Reads Editor Review: </strong>“My favorite type of historical novel is what I like to call “women in places they shouldn’t be”–stories of women doing something groundbreaking. Set in the glamorous and dangerous world of Prohibition-era Los Angeles, against a backdrop of golden-age Hollywood, hidden speakeasys, and ruthless gangsters, The Bootlegger’s Daughter is what would happen if L.A. Confidential met Peaky Blinders…and was told from the women’s side of the story.</p><p>In the 1920s, one of the few remaining vineyards is run by Letty Hart, who had to take over the family business after her father abandoned her and her mother. She’s trying to find a way to keep the farm alive and a roof over their heads. Annabel Forman is determined to become the first female detective in the LAPD but is passed over again and again. She knows she has to do something extraordinary to get what she’s already earned. As the bootlegger builds her empire and the pioneering officer builds her case, a murder sets the two on a collision course.</p><p>I was rooting for Letty and Annabel even as they made (sometimes less-than-legal) choices and applauding as they succeeded against all odds in worlds where women so rarely find themselves. Inspired in part by the true stories of real women bootleggers (many of whom were—unsurprisingly—better at the crime than the men) and the first female police officer in the US, this page-turning mystery explores the difficult decisions necessary to survive at all—let alone in a man’s world.”</p><p><strong>—Chantelle Aimée Osman, Amazon First Reads Editor</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/my-favorite-terrible-thing-madeleine-henry-amazon.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=my-favorite-terrible-thing-by-madeleine-henry>My Favorite Terrible Thing by Madeleine Henry&nbsp;</h2><ul><li><strong>Genre: </strong>Mystery</li><li><strong>Rating: </strong>3.7 out of 5 (633 reviews)</li></ul><p><strong>Amazon Synopsis: </strong>“Detective Nina Travers is so good at her job that she blends in like a benevolent Tom Ripley.

But fear follows Beth home, and pushing past it becomes a fixation.</p><p>She and her boyfriend, Tommy, train obsessively, achieving rock-climbing greatness and conquering each groundbreaking goal they set, all the while burying the terrors of Kyrgyzstan deep inside. Then comes an unexpected breaking point. For Beth, a woman at the top of her profession, the only way to overcome the anxiety that still controls her is to let go of the lifeline she’s been clinging to. Blowing up her successful and familiar life, Beth clears a path to a new one—a healthy new normal beyond the anxieties of the past and the myopic pursuit of athletic perfection.</p><p>Charting a powerful journey of ambition, hope, love, physical and emotional endurance, and the true fulfilment of being oneself, A Light through the Cracks is Beth’s story of climbing up and through life.”</p><p><strong>Amazon First Reads Editor Review: </strong>“Beth Rodden was only twenty years old—not even old enough to order a beer—on a sponsored expedition to Kyrgyzstan when she and her fellow climbers were taken hostage. The unique terror that they experienced and harrowingly escaped from followed young Beth home. Beth went from a woman who specialized in taking measured risk to molding her entire life around control, protection, and the methodical achievement of curated greatness.</p><p>In A Light through the Cracks, Beth not only brings the reader thousands of feet above the valley floor, clinging to narrow cracks and imperceptible ridges on a rock face—she also brings that same focus and vulnerability to her personal story of coping with PTSD while outwardly living the life she’d always dreamed of.</p><p>But when that life wasn’t enough—when she finally let herself step off of the prescribed path, she found a life that was beautifully, dangerously imperfect. Beth Rodden’s story is electrifying, raw, and inspiring.”</p><p><strong>—Laura Van der Veer, Amazon First Reads Editor</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ibpaHBtr7EaGhwbGlofnh7wKaYs6eeYrOqvtKtZKudkZnAbrDEmqNo</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2famazon-first-reads-deal.html&title=Get%202%20Free%20Kindle%20Books%20In%20April%202024" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2famazon-first-reads-deal.html&description=Get%202%20Free%20Kindle%20Books%20In%20April%202024" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2famazon-first-reads-deal.html&title=Get%202%20Free%20Kindle%20Books%20In%20April%202024" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2famazon-first-reads-deal.html&title=Get%202%20Free%20Kindle%20Books%20In%20April%202024" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2famazon-first-reads-deal.html&text=Get%202%20Free%20Kindle%20Books%20In%20April%202024" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2famazon-first-reads-deal.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Larita Shotwell</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-09-04</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./malaysia-singapore-users-x-slam-israeli-activists-bid-sow-discord-between-neighbours-were.html><h3>&lt;&lt; Malaysia, Singapore users on X slam Israeli activists bid to sow discord between neighbours: w</h3></a><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./echosmith-signs-with-33-west-for-north-american-representation.html><h3>Echosmith Signs With 33 &amp;amp; West For North American Representation >></h3></a></div></div></section></section><div></div></div></div><footer class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h sk3-margin-v-full sk3-pad-v-full"><div class="sk3-pad-h txt-center-h">©
