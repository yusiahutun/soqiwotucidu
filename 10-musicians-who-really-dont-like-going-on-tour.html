Between changing cities every night, performing late into the night and long stretches away from home, touring can take a mental and physical toll on musicians. That's why some of the world’s biggest stars admit that they're just not a fan of hitting the road. Despite fans’ desires to see their favorite performers on tour, sometimes it just isn't the best idea.</p><p>Read on to find out why these stars don't like touring…</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:e9e679bc-67d3-4982-a228-abdef07276e7 data-container-ref=toofab:article:dba7305e-3ab3-46e8-944f-bff99e724f5d data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/93/5by4/2023/05/21/93b234197afd4b798e0269fde9ea4eb9_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Miley Cyrus May Never Do Another Headline Tour: 'Isn't Really the Thing That I Love'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>1. </strong><a href=#><strong>Miley Cyrus</strong></a></p><p>Miley Cyrus hasn't embarked on a major headlining tour since 2014 and even though her fans want her to hit the road again, she doesn't see it in her future. She recently explained that while she loves performing, touring is "not natural" and is "isolating because you're in front of 100,000 people then you are alone."</p><p>"After the last [headline tour] I did, I kind of looked at it as more of a question. And I can't. Not only can't, because can't is your capability, but my desire. Do I want to live my life for anyone else's pleasure or fulfillment other than my own?" she told <a href=#>British Vogue</a>. "Like singing for hundreds of thousands of people isn't really the thing that I love. There's no connection. There's no safety."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>Miley later clarified her comments, sharing a statement on Instagram last month.</p><p>"For clarity I feel connected to my fans NOW more than ever. When I win, WE win. ❤️," she began. "Even if I don't see them face to face every night at a concert, my fans are felt deeply in my heart. I'm constantly creating and innovating new ways that I can stay connected to the audience I love -- without sacrificing my own essentials."</p><p>"Performing for YOU has been some of the best days of my life & we will continue this journey together as we have for the last almost two decades," she continued. "This has nothing to do with a lack of appreciation for the fans & everything to do with I simply don't want to get ready in a locker room. Which is the reality of life on the road."</p><p>"These looks I've been turning don't travel well. The archival looks don't fold. I just don't want to sleep on a moving bus," Miley added, before noting that this is "what's best" for her currently, but she may "change" how she feels in the future.</p><p><strong>2. </strong><a href=#><strong>Shawn Mendes</strong></a></p><p>Shawn Mendes recently opted to cancel all of his upcoming tour dates in order to prioritize his mental health. While reflecting on the situation in an open letter to fans, Shawn admitted he didn't realize what a "toll" being on the road would take on him and found that he was not ready for “how difficult” touring would be.</p><p>"I had to postpone the past few weeks of shows since I wasn't totally prepared for the toll that being back on the road would take on me. I started this tour excited to finally get back to playing live after a long break due to the pandemic, but the reality is I was not at all ready for how difficult touring would be after this time away," Shawn <a href=#>wrote</a>.</p><p>He continued, "After speaking more with my team and working with an incredible group of health professionals, it has become more clear that I need to take the time I've never taken personally to ground myself and come back stronger."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:6028b57b-d1d0-472f-9468-f1054b5e7225 data-container-ref=toofab:article:dba7305e-3ab3-46e8-944f-bff99e724f5d data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/33/5by4/2023/04/24/33ce1dde9e774d9f8ad33bd8aa8e038f_xs.png width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h4 class=article-block__card-title>Watch Adele, James Corden Both Break Down During Emotional, Final Carpool Karaoke</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>3. </strong><a href=#><strong>Adele</strong></a></p><p>Back when Adele was wrapping up her tour for her album "25," she revealed that she didn't think she was very good at touring. In a now-deleted handwritten letter to fans, Adele explained that after 15 months on the road, she had finally gotten used to it -- but still didn't like it.</p><p>"Touring is a peculiar thing, it doesn't suit me particularly well," she <a href=#>wrote</a>. "I'm a real homebody and I get so much joy in the small things. Plus I’m dramatic and have a terrible history of touring. Until now that is! I’ve done 119 shows…It has been hard out an absolute thrill and pleasure to have done."</p><p>Then, before the release of her album "30," Adele shared that she didn't plan to tour around the new release. While she didn't end up taking the show on the road, she did schedule a Las Vegas residency which helped her stay in one place while performing shows.</p><p><strong>4. </strong><a href=#><strong>Zayn Malik</strong></a></p><p>Zayn Malik has long had a complicated relationship with touring and being on stage. Back in 2016, he revealed that he was dealing with intense anxiety that made performing incredibly difficult and touring an unpleasant experience. While he was working to get better, Zayn continually had to cancel shows throughout the year.</p><p>"I've been working over the last three months to overcome my extreme anxiety around major live solo performances. I feel I am making progress but I have today acknowledged that I do not feel sufficiently confident to move forward with the planned show in Dubai,” he <a href=#>wrote</a> at the time, later adding, "I cannot apologize enough. I know those who suffer anxiety will understand and I hope those who don't can empathize with my situation."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:841c7440-faeb-46d3-85e2-f0b43ee42bf3 data-container-ref=toofab:article:dba7305e-3ab3-46e8-944f-bff99e724f5d data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/5b/5by4/2023/05/26/5bf69cac3f4b44b5ac7c82e8311d8991_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Britney Spears Opens Up About First Visit with Mom Lynne Spears After Three Years</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>5. </strong><a href=#><strong>Britney Spears</strong></a></p><p>Britney Spears has had her fair share of struggles in the entertainment industry -- and that includes touring. In 2021, she wrote that she didn't see herself ever touring again because she disliked it so much in the past.</p><p>"I know I'm not playing in huge arenas with my loud band anymore but I will be honest and say life on the road is hard !!!" she <a href=#>wrote</a> in a since-deleted post.

According to his friend 50 Cent, Eminem would often fly home after shows so he could take Hailie to school the day next and it got to be tiring.</p><p>"I've toured more than him because he has Hailie, and he likes to physically be at the house. A lot of people don't know the reason behind him touring less -- but Hailie would put boxes in front of the door thinking this would stop him going," he reportedly told <a href=#>MTV</a>. "He would fly back on a private plane after the show so he could drive her to school in the morning, so for him the tour was exhausting."</p><p><strong>8.</strong><a href=#><strong> Skylar Gray</strong></a></p><p>Skylar Gray, who collaborated with Eminem on "Love The Way You Lie," admits she isn't a big fan of touring. While she says she enjoys the actual shows, it's the rest of the experience that is tough for her. Instead, she'd prefer being in the studio or playing one-off shows.</p><p>"Everybody in the industry will combat me on this, but I don't want to be on tour. I don’t enjoy being on the road. I enjoy the shows themselves, but every other aspect of it -- the travel, being away from home -- that kind of stuff I hate. And life is too short to wake up and do something you hate every day. So I really enjoy being in the studio. I really enjoy making music videos. And I’m kind of just designing my own career style," she told <a href=#>Variety</a>.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:e957be72-82be-4194-b18c-68162acb5aea data-container-ref=toofab:article:dba7305e-3ab3-46e8-944f-bff99e724f5d data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/38/5by4/2023/05/05/38f0e7f1de14447abc98847fd36de5ea_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Fox/Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kevin McHale and Jenna Ushkowitz Recall 'Strange' Times with Britney Spears on Glee Set</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>9. </strong><a href=#><strong>Billy Joel</strong></a></p><p>As Billy Joel has progressed in his career, he says he's become less excited about touring.

She didn't tour again for 27 years and has now permanently stopped touring, explaining that it's just exhausting for her.</p><p>"No. No. I know. I can't. It's just too vulnerable. It's too hard for me. I wish I loved it. There are so many performers who perform practically the whole year, you know, 200 or 300 days a year. They love it. And I wish I felt that way," she told <a href=#>Billboard</a>. "It would be great because it's very lucrative but I can't do it. It’s just too hard. I think about what I eat after the show.
