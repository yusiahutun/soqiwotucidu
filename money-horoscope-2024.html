Between inflation and the strained job market, the financial astrology of 2023 most certainly felt bleak at times. Although this might be hard to believe, the financial astrology of 2024 seems to be more promising than anticipated. The stars will align and bring forth multiple opportunities for financial growth.</p><p>The start of the show will be Jupiter! In astrology, Jupiter rules over luck, abundance, and growth. This happy-go-lucky planet is kind of like the King Midas of astrology since everything Jupiter touches turns to gold. No matter the Jupiter transit, you can always use Jupiter’s serendipity to turn your luck around.&nbsp;</p><p>From January 1, 2024, to May 25, 2024, the planet of luck <a href=#>will be in fiscally-</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">focused</a><a href=#> Taurus</a>. During this time, Jupiter will expand upon the Taurus themes of personal wealth, materialism, and value systems. Long-awaited opportunities aligned with your financial goals and professional values may fall into place during Jupiter in Taurus. You could even sell old items to buy higher quality replacements that will stand the test of time. The only potential downside to Jupiter in Taurus will be over-indulging by overspending.&nbsp;</p><p>By May 25, 2024, a new financial trend will arise since <a href=#>Jupiter will </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>enter</a><a href=#> Gemini</a> and be in the sign of the twins for the remainder of 2024. According to traditional astrology, Jupiter in Gemini might present more obstacles and challenges. But don’t let this get you down! Jupiter in Gemini will encourage you to become more financially literate. You might benefit from reading more on financial outlets, speaking to a financial advisor, or listening to economic podcasts. Since the keyword is “multiple”, the key to Jupiter in Gemini will be investing in several accounts. You could have a few stock portfolios, a 401K, a Roth IRA, a high-yield savings account, and more. Not to mention that most individuals may even multi-task several jobs, like a regular nine-to-five and at least one side hustle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Copy-of-List-Redirect-Design-8.png><p>Luck may turn on a dime when <a href=#>Jupiter stations </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">retrograde</a><a href=#> in Gemini</a> from October 9, 2024, to February 4, 2025. Whatever you worked on over the last few months may hit a wall. You could find fewer accessible resources on financial literacy, so you may not learn anything new. Side hustles might become far and few in between. Even your consistent, seemingly stable side hustles might not have as many hours or assignments as before. There might be some professional and financial instability, you may have to take some money out of your savings. Not to mention that your stocks could either lose value or stagnate, so you may not see a substantial difference during Jupiter retrograde in Gemini. The best way to handle this retrograde is to have a semi-flexible plan, which may include cutting down on frivolous pastimes and becoming more creative to make money.</p><p>Lastly, there might be one transit that could go either way in 2024, and that is Uranus in Taurus. According to astrology, Uranus is the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">planet of radical change and innovation</a>, so this is a challenging planet to track for financial trends. Regardless, there might be a sudden change of pace when Uranus stations direct in Taurus on January 27, 2024. Once direct, you may entertain unique financial possibilities over the following months. Drastic measures could be taken to increase your means for financial stability and security. However, there might be fewer twists and turns when Uranus stations retrograde in Taurus from September 1, 2024, to January 31, 2025. During the remainder of 2024, Uranus retrograde may encourage you to be more reflective about what you value for your financial avenues.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=your-2024-money-horoscope-for-each-zodiac-sign>Your 2024 Money Horoscope For Each Zodiac Sign</h2><p>Here’s what you anticipate for your 2024 financial trends, according to your <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>sun sign</a> and/or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>rising sign</a> (and seriously, you’re missing out if you don’t read these horoscopes for your rising sign):</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6.7774244833068><h2>Aries</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Aries.png><p>Aries, your most promising month will be May since several planets will activate your second house of personal assets. Set realistic financial goals and dedicate yourself to following a budget to meet your goals over the next six months during the new moon in Taurus on May 7, 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>Mid-May will be the perfect time to make a quick buck from odd jobs and short-term contracts. You could sell miscellaneous items from your spring cleaning on Facebook Marketplace or hold a yard sale. Since your innovation could result in a decent profit, you should be mindful about how you spend and save that money. You ought to focus on paying off your essential expenses. But if you can save your money, then invest your money into a high-yield savings account or Roth IRA.</p><p>While May seems prosperous, you might experience economic issues throughout October and part of November since the cosmic energy will hit your eighth house of debt. Your family or household might have unexpected expenses to cover. Although there might be times when your expenses may seem dire, the fall could be the perfect time to refinance whatever debt you have to lighten your financial load.&nbsp;<a href=#>Read your full 2024 yearly horoscope </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=12.117537313433><h2>Taurus</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Taurus.png><p>Usually, you stick to tried-and-true financial methods. However, it might be worth exploring new pathways to increase your abundance when your second house of financial stability is activated once Jupiter enters Gemini on May 25, 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>Have an open mind as you explore your financial opportunities since some options might be short-term or something you wouldn’t typically go for. I recommend seeking noncommittal work that capitalizes on Gemini’s talents, which include writing, editing, mentoring, teaching, and working with your hands. There will be a plethora of opportunities to consider throughout the first half of June.&nbsp;</p><p>The end of 2024 might be more financially strenuous. You may have fewer hours, contracts, or under-the-table opportunities since Jupiter will station retrograde in Gemini from October 9, 2024, to February 4, 2025. Then your eighth house of debt will experience some financial mishaps thanks to Mercury retrograde in Sagittarius, which will occur from November 25, 2024, to December 16, 2024. Keep an eye on fraudulent charges during this time and be mindful of scammers. You should also stick to a budget to avoid significant credit card debt if you plan on shopping for gifts to give this holiday season.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Read your full 2024 yearly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=10.161570247934><h2>Gemini</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Gemini.png><p>You will have to give to get, Gemini. June and July could be a financially prosperous period if you nurture long and short-term financial possibilities. You may feel like you can only pursue financial opportunities aligned with your career path at the end of June. However, this mindset might delay your ability to fulfill your goals.&nbsp;</p><p>Once the new moon in Cancer rises on July 5, 2024, you may feel more inclined to seek opportunities that will nurture your financial goals. The astrology of July should be financially easier. Use this time to apply to remote jobs and see if you can work with your family to make extra cash. You could also refine your lifestyle to cut down on your expenses.</p><p>Meanwhile, you may have two chances to expunge any lingering debt or financial hardships since there will be two full moons in Capricorn. The first full moon will be on June 21, 2024, and this might encourage you to let go of restrictive mindsets that curtail your ability to make, save, and budget your money. If you need an extra boost, the second blue full moon on July 21, 2024, will give you a much-needed push.&nbsp;<a href=#>Read your full yearly 2024 </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">horoscope</a><a href=#> here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=14.996034892942><h2>Cancer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Cancer.png><p>Face your fears, Cancer! You will have to take a deeper look into your finances when Pluto enters Aquarius on January 20, 2024. Before this Plutonic transit begins, you should reflect on what came up the last time Pluto was in Aquarius, which was from March 23, 2023, to June 11, 2023. Whatever arose then may return in 2024.</p><p>While Pluto is direct in Aquarius, you should use this time to conquer your fears of debt, financial entanglements, and poverty. You can amplify your power by using this cosmic energy to become more financially literate. If you need to revise your debts, stocks, credit scores, and retirement plans, do so when Pluto stations retrograde in Aquarius from May 2, 2024, to September 1, 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>Financial strain may come at the end of 2024 thanks to Mars stationing retrograde in Leo from December 6, 2024, to January 7, 2025. Mars retrograde will impact your second house of personal wealth, so you may feel like you’re burning a hole in your pocket. You’ll likely experience increased spending during this period, especially as you prepare for the holiday season.

Winter could be an excellent time to enhance your financial literacy if you are open to investing your money into a high-yield savings account, Roth IRA, or 401K.
