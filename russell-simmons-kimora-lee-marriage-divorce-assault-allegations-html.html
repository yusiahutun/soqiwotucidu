and despite her friends warning her that Russell, who was 35 at the time, was someone she should steer clear of, she fell quickly for the music executive.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The romance was scandalous from the start - she was still a high school student and he was 18 years her senior - and the immense age gap, as well as&nbsp;Russell's flirtatious behavior, did not make for a great foundation for the love affair.</p><img id=i-f8a26beea510ed30 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/12/08/19/78745577-12841751-Take_a_look_back_at_Russell_Simmons_and_Kimora_Lee_Simmons_rolle-a-37_1702065233488.jpg height=920 width=634 alt="Take a look back at Russell Simmons and Kimora Lee Simmons' rollercoaster ride marriage and bitter divorce as he insists he was 'never violent' towards anyone in rare interview" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Take a look back at Russell Simmons and Kimora Lee Simmons' rollercoaster ride marriage and bitter divorce as he insists he was 'never violent' towards anyone in rare interview</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The early years of the relationship were plagued by Russell's continued infidelities and his inability to 'settle down' - but when Kimora threatened to leave him once and for all after she walked in on him 'making out' with another woman during a New Year's Eve party, the Def Jam founder vowed to change.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She told Russell that he would have to prove his loyalty once and for all by marrying her or that she was done - and he shocked her (and the rest of the world) by choosing the first option.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The two walked down the aisle in 1998, and together, they quickly welcomed two daughters together - and&nbsp;many wondered if becoming a husband and father would finally tame the famous seducer.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But unfortunately, it didn't.
