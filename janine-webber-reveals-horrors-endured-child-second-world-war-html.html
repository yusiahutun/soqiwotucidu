Before the war, it was a thriving centre, filled with theatres, universities and an opera house.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Polish Catholics, Ukrainian Orthodox Christians and Jews lived side by side, with the Jews respected for their contribution to the region's status as a centre for intellectual, cultural and academic excellence. 'There were nearly 150,000 Jews living in Lvov,' Webber says. 'That sounds a little like the word 'love', doesn't it? Well, I must tell you, there was very little love shown towards our family.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Webber's family lived in a second-floor flat in the centre of town and spent the holidays in a village nearby. She still has a photo taken one summer of her mother Lipka in her bathing costume, lounging on the grass (see opposite). Her parents ran a local grocery store while her grandmother looked after her and her brother. Every Saturday, her father Alfred took her to the orthodox synagogue where the men sat on one side and the women on the other.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'But I was allowed to sit with my father,' she says. 'All the men made a fuss of me and I loved it.' Then in 1941 the Nazis invaded her city and her family were plunged into an apocalyptic nightmare. Within days, the German secret police and death squads began targeting Jewish men, dragging them out of their homes and on to the streets to shoot them.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-91ba4ee160e5d0a0 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/01/17/22/66682961-11646151-image-a-68_1673995080784.jpg height=403 width=634 alt="Janine, next to Tunio, far right, in a treasured family photo of her mother relaxing on holiday" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Janine, next to Tunio, far right, in a treasured family photo of her mother relaxing on holiday</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Webber remembers her father running into their flat, shouting, 'The Germans are after me!' With the Gestapo hammering at the door, he leapt off their second-floor balcony, breaking his leg but managing to escape.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Next time he would not be so lucky. The Germans began seizing all Jewish property and since the ghetto was still being established, Webber's family was forcibly moved into a small room in a shared house.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Gestapo's raids were constant, so her parents created a tiny hiding space under the floorboards beneath a wardrobe. 'There was only room for me, my mother and Tunio,' she says.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The next raid came without warning. The Gestapo found her father and grandmother hiding in the loft. Webber still remembers her grandmother's screams as they were both dragged away to be shot.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As the war intensified, 120,000 Jews were sent to the newly created ghetto, crammed together with scant food and no sanitation.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Typhus was rife and dead bodies littered the&nbsp;streets. Webber recalls seeing soldiers piling up bodies into carts. 'They threw sick people on top of the corpses, even if they were still alive.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When her mother got typhus, her uncle Selig hid her in the basement and tried to nurse her to recovery. Webber crept downstairs to see her. 'I couldn't understand why she didn't look at me or talk to me. She was always so affectionate.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Selig explained to her later that her mother was already dead. She was 29. Amid this deprivation, Selig scraped together enough money to pay for Polish farmers to give Webber a home. But even this proved to be unsafe as she was put in a bed with the farmer's 15-year-old son, who tried to have sex with her. She managed to fend him off, but her punishment was to be locked alone in a room for several months with only a bed and a bucket.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-e2c70a3a1a1b3600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/01/17/22/66682965-11646151-image-a-69_1673995109729.jpg height=887 width=634 alt="Tunio, aged 18 months, 1935.

They gave me an old coat infested with lice,' she says. 'I kept killing the lice but having something to do saved my mind because I was starting to imagine I saw animals in the walls.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Webber can only guess at why the farmers finally let her go – maybe they had enough of feeding her or thought it was too dangerous to shelter a Jewish child. She found her way back to the ghetto, where Selig once again got the money to pay for another Polish farming family to give her and also Tunio shelter.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But it was here that the farmer's daughter betrayed them to the Nazi officer – who allowed Webber to escape, but who shot and wounded Tunio then buried him alive.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Does she, I wonder, believe some people are inherently evil? 'I don't believe people are born evil,' she says. 'I believe people can be brainwashed.' She retains her belief in the goodness of humanity because of the courage of a Polish Catholic teenager named Edek, who risked his life to save hers.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After Webber escaped from the farm, she found herself orphaned and alone. All she had in her possession were her treasured photographs and the address of Edek, a member of the Polish Resistance.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He was a friend of her mother's sister, Aunt Rouja, and was employed as a night watchman for the Persenkowka convent on the outskirts of Lvov. It was in the grounds of the convent that Edek managed to build an underground bunker to hide Webber, Rouja, Selig and 11 other Jews.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It was very small,' she explains. 'We could stand up but not walk around. There was a naked bulb in the ceiling and six planks to sleep on, so we had to take it in turns to lie down. There was no daylight, no air. It was very hot. I only wore underwear.' She lived in that underground hole for almost a year.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In 1943, as Webber's health began to deteriorate, Rouja managed to smuggle her out of the bunker by obtaining false papers for her. Webber had to assume a new identity, that of a dead Catholic girl named Janina Kopielska, whose parents had been killed, and learn every detail about her life.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She found&nbsp;shelter in another convent, in Krakow, where she mouthed the words to the prayers so no one would realise she wasn't Catholic. Her leg muscles were so weak from living underground that the Mother Superior told her she'd never walk properly again.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-50e03a3b3d5a8b3b src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/01/17/22/66682959-11646151-image-a-70_1673995141330.jpg height=852 width=634 alt="Janine, left, aged four, with her mother and Tunio, 1936.&nbsp;The Gestapo's raids on their flat were constant, so her parents created a tiny hiding space under the floorboards beneath a wardrobe.

All of those in the bunker survived the war, although Webber regrets that she never saw Edek again to thank him. 'If he'd been caught hiding us, he would have been executed,' she says. 'So, his bravery is almost unimaginable.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After the liberation, she settled in Paris and married her first husband Norman Galloway and had twin sons, Stephen and Mark. Later she moved to London, marrying her second husband, engineer Edward Webber, but remains a committed Francophile and used to work as a lecturer in French.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She is close to all her children, stepchildren and grandchildren, but for 50 years, Webber never spoke about what she endured, even&nbsp;to her own family. 'It was too painful.' The trauma gave her recurrent nightmares of Nazi officers in shiny black boots. She was terrified of anyone finding out where she lived, scared to open her front door to strangers.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As part of her recovery, her psychotherapist suggested she start opening up about her ordeal. Once she began telling her story, the nightmares stopped. Now her diary is packed with talks to schools, churches and other organisations. 'I also give more interviews Davi online,' she says.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Often people respond with&nbsp;emails and that makes me really, really happy.' She regularly travels to Nottinghamshire to address visitors at the National Holocaust Centre & Museum. Its director Marc Cave is full of admiration for her: 'I always get a pang of jealousy when someone says they're seeing Janine,' he writes to me in an email.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Every time she speaks about her baby brother, I think she's going to crack. But Janine is prepared to pay the price of personal trauma by reliving it every time she talks in the hope of helping other people. That's the equation – 'I suffer, but I'm prepared to suffer if it inspires you to be a better human being.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>New government figures show that antisemitic hate incidents are at a record high and so there is an increasing urgency to find new ways to make survivors' stories resonate.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Webber recently collaborated with Cave and hip-hop artist Kapoo to create Edek, an award-winning short film described as 'a history lesson for the YouTube generation'.
